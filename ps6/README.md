## Cash

### Instructions
Using Luhn's algorithm, a checksum formula, build a program to detect whether a credit card is valid or not. Furthermore, if valid, the program should be able to tell whether the credit card belongs to Mastercard, VISA, or AMEX.

### Usage
Your program should behave like the following:

```
$ ./cash
Change owed: 0.41
4
```

```
$ ./cash
Change owed: -0.41
Change owed: foo
Change owed: 0.41
4
```
